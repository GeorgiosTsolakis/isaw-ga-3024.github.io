<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elymais"</a>Elymais or Elamais (Ἐλυμαΐς, Hellenic form of the more ancient name, Elam) was a semi-independent state of the 2nd century BC to the early 3rd century AD, frequently a vassal under Parthian control, and located at the head of the Persian Gulf in the present-day region of Khuzestan, Iran (Susiana).[1] It is reported that these people were great archers and natives of Susa, which lay to the east of Elymais territory. Most of the Elymais were probably descendants of the ancient Elamites,[1] who once had control of that area in the past. The provinces of Elymais were Massabatice (later Masabadhan), Corbiane and Gabian</p>
