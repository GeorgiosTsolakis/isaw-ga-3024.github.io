<p> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham%27s_Palace'>It is <i>difficult</i> to establish a secure <b>historical framework</b> for Hisham's Palace. 
	No textual sources reference the site, and archaeological excavations are 
	the only source of further information. <b><i>An ostracon bearing the name Hisham</b></i> 
	was found during the course of Baramki's excavations'</a></p>
