<p> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham%27s_Palace'>It is difficult to establish a secure historical framework for Hisham's Palace. 
	No textual sources reference the site, and archaeological excavations are 
	the only source of further information. An ostracon bearing the name Hisham 
	was found during the course of Baramki's excavations'</a></p>
