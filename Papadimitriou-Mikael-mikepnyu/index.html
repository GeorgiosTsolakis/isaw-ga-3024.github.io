<p> The age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">Constantine</a> marked a distinct epoch in the history of the <i>Roman Empire</i>.[5] He built a new imperial residence at Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople after himself (the laudatory epithet of "New Rome" came later, and was never an official title). It would later become the capital of the Empire for over one thousand years; for which reason the later <i>Eastern Empire</i> would come to be known as the <b>Byzantine Empire</b>. His more immediate political legacy was that, in leaving the empire to his sons, he replaced Diocletian's tetrarchy with the principle of dynastic succession. His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and centuries after his reign. The <b>medieval church</b> upheld him as a paragon of virtue while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity.[6] Beginning with the <i>Renaissance</i>, there were more critical appraisals of his reign due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources. Critics portrayed him as a tyrant. Trends in modern and recent scholarship attempted to balance the extremes of previous scholarship.</p>
