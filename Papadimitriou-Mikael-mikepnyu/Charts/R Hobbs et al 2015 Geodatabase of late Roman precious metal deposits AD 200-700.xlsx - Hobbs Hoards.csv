The tile was part of a substantial masonry structure; the farmer had previously noticed a large amount of Roman material lying around on the surface. Excavations followed which revealed that the hoard itself lay in a substantial masonry building with red stucco walls, which was proposed as a temple of Mercury. Another temple (a santuary of Maia) was discovered nearby. The excavators also discovered evidence of burning, and a number of bodies, which obviously implied that the destruction was rapid. Roman coins run from Augustus to Constantine II, but the material is believed to have been buried in the third century.
