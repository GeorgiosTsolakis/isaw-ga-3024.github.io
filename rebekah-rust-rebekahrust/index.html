<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_tragedy">The origin of Greek tragedy</a> is one of the <b>unsolved problems<b> of classical scholarship. Ruth Scodel notes that, due to lack of evidence and doubtful reliability of sources, we know nearly nothing about tragedy's origin.[6] Still, R.P. Winnington-Ingram points out that we can easily trace various influences from other genres.[7] The stories that tragedy deals with stem from epic and lyric poetry, its meter — the iambic trimeter — owed much to the political rhetoric of Solon, and the choral songs' dialect, meter and vocabulary seem to originate in choral lyric. How these have come to be associated with one another remains a mystery however.</p>
