<p>Since the early nineteenth century, the fascination with ancient Egypt seems to have affected every field of American culture. Some of the most important areas of culture influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptomania">Egyptomania</a> are literature, architecture, art, film, politics and religion. There were <b>two important waves</b> of Egyptomania in the nineteenth century, especially in arts and design, which were both caused by publications about Egypt that became very popular: Vivant Denon, <i>Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypt</i> (1802), and the Institute of Egypt's <i>Description de l'Egypte</i> (1809).</p>
